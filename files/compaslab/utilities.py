    # Clean the compas dataset according to the description provided by ProPublica of their analysis.
    # In the original notebook the authors state:

    # There are a number of reasons remove rows because of missing data:

        # If the charge date of a defendants Compas scored crime was not within 30 days from when the person was arrested,
        # we assume that because of data quality reasons, that we do not have the right offense.

        # We coded the recidivist flag -- `is_recid` -- to be -1 if we could not find a compas case at all.

        # In a similar vein, ordinary traffic offenses -- those with a `c_charge_degree` of 'O' -- will not result in Jail time
        # are removed (only two of them).

        # We filtered the underlying data from Broward county to include only those rows representing people who had either
        # recidivated in two years, or had at least two years outside of a correctional facility.

    # ix is the index of variables we want to keep.
    # Remove entries with inconsistent arrest information.
